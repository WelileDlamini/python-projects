#In this code, we are using the Google Maps API to calculate the distance and duration between each pair of delivery locations in Swaziland. We then define an optimization function that minimizes the total distance traveled by the delivery vehicle. We apply this function to the distances matrix to generate an optimized delivery route. Finally, we print the optimized delivery route to the console.

#Note that this is just a sample code, and you will need to modify it to suit your specific distribution requirements in Swaziland. You may also need to incorporate additional data sources, algorithms, and techniques for effective distribution management.
